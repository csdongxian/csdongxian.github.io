I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Tokyo, hosted by Prof. [Masashi Sugiyama](http://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sugi/index.html). 

Before this, I got my PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, co-advised by Prof. [Shu-Tao Xia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=koAXTXgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Prof. [Yisen Wang](https://yisenwang.github.io/). 

My research mainly focuses on trustworthy machine learning, especially adversarial learning and data security.
