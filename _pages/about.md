I am an enthusiast for building a trustworthy AI system. I received my PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, co-supervised by Prof. [Shu-Tao Xia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=koAXTXgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Prof. [Yisen Wang](https://yisenwang.github.io/). Currently, I am a Project Researcher (Postdoctoral Researcher) at the University of Tokyo, supervised by Prof. [Masashi Sugiyama](http://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sugi/index.html).

My research mainly focuses on adversarial learning and data security (especially backdoor attacks).
